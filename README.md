Hi, I’m @PhilGanney

My main coding interests are websites and apps that help small/medium businesses and individuals. 
My solo projects are about innovating by applying existing techs, to new things, or with really nice designs.

Big projects that I am proud of include:
 - btncode.com - a web based, code-editing/reference tool.  (A pet project that I still add to and I will be keeping online)
    - Kind of a cross between a quick reference and jsfiddle. 
    - Built to make it easier for developers to use coding languages they are less familiar with
    - It also has a responsive design that makes it pleasant to use on mobile, making it handy for visualising code ideas when they strike at random times.
    - I will soon be building a new version of it in react, by using the version I built in Vanilla JavaScript. I am fairly new to react, so this is a great chance to see how much btnCode helps!
 - TeaRounder - tools for making food and drink ordering easier. (website no longer online, but the code is still here should anyone want to use it).
    -  I attempted to make a business out of this in 2020-2022 (perhaps the hardest time within my lifetime to start a business, but a great experience nonetheless) 
    - started out in 2019 as a personal use drinks list app, to quickly create a list of what friends want to order, so that social events where smoother and less reliant on someone remembering a long list of drinks. At this stage, just a personal project to learn "hybrid app development", and get better at mobile design. 
    - Sometime in 2020 around the time of "Eat out to help out", I got excited about pivoting TeaRounder into a web-app for cafe/pub "at-table ordering" thereby helping cafes/pubs safely handle orders. I started looking into getting VC funding, and a whole load of infrastructure stuff that turned out to not be needed
    - in 2021, when my local area was coming back out of yet another lockdown, one day whilst sifting through ads for contracts pub ordering version via WooCommerce

For small-scale web-apps and prototypes, I like to work in HTML, CSS & "vanilla" JavaScript if viable. 
   - HTML, CSS & "vanilla" JavaScript give low filesizes, fast loading times, easy prototyping up to a point and great control over the end result. They get a bit cumbersome at larger scale though. 
   - I add in useful JavaScript libraries when it seems overly time-consuming to develop something in "vanilla" JavaScript that a libary excels at. (for example, jQuery in TeaRounder for the ordering functionality, to make Ajax calls significantly easier, massively reducing development time)
   - I tend to use PHP when something needs to be done server side, though have some experience with C# and Python too.
   - whenever I need to build a database I use mySQL

For websites, what I use depends mostly on the owners tech ability and what features are needed:
   - Wordpress is great for most projects - very customizable and full of features, whilst being easy for the website owner to update the text and pictures. It's pretty quick to get a nice looking mobile friendly brochure website up and running, any of the common but advanced things you might want to do with a website can be added via plugins, and anything that doesn't exist as a plugin yet could be added via a custom made plugin if really needed.
   - Many other CMS (Content Management Systems) and "website builders" exist too. I'll work in them if a client or collaborator prefers, though that generally requires a bit of time for me to find where everything is in those tools, and they vary in how much you can customize a website built in them, and what features can be put in.
   - by painful experience, I only use HTML, CSS and JS for websites if I'm confident that the owner is skilled enough with those techs to be able to update the website themselves. Even for websites I'm looking after, wordpress is my current preference, except for the homepages of web-apps. WordPress just makes updating text and pictures so much more effecient and how people would expect, compared with updating HTML.
   
Over my career I've used a whole bunch of different programming languages, databases and frameworks - giving me quite a broad understanding of whats out there and different ways of doing things in code
   - Python is my second favourite programming language after JavaScript, though I've yet to use it for anything beyond little fun projects - I'd quite like that to change!
   - C# and Java feel great for highly engineered projects. I've not used them in my public projects though.
   - mySQL and MS SQL Server are both great for storing data when JSON won't do. One of my personal projects "SQL GUI" is a tool to make designing databases easy to do on phones
