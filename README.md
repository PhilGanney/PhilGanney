Hi, I’m @PhilGanney

My main coding interests are websites and apps that help small businesses and individuals. 
My projects are about innovating by applying existing techs, to new things, or with really nice designs.
Big projects that I am proud of include:
TeaRounder - tools for making food and drink ordering easier.
    personal use version, to quickly create a list of what people want to order: tearounder.app/anywhere/start.html
    pub ordering demo at tearounder.app/TheLoremIpsum
btncode.com - a web based, code-editing/reference tool. Kind of a cross between a cheat-sheet and jsfiddle. It has a responsive design that makes it pleasant to use on mobile - handy for visualising code ideas when they strike at random times.

For web-apps, I like to work directly in HTML, CSS & "vanilla" JavaScript wherever possible
   - These are great for the amount of control I have over the end result, the low filesizes that give fast loading times and the ease of prototyping
   - I add in useful JavaScript libraries when it seems overly time-consuming to achieve something in "vanilla" JavaScript that a libary excels at. I consider this the best of both worlds. (for example, jQuery in TeaRounder for the ordering functionality, to make Ajax calls significantly easier, massively reducing development time)
   - I use PHP when something needs to be done server side
   - whenever I need to build a database I use mySQL

For websites, what I use depends mostly on the owners tech ability and what features are needed:
   - Wordpress is great for most projects - very customizable and full of features, whilst being easy for the website owner to update the text and pictures. It's pretty quick to get a nice looking mobile friendly brochure website up and running, any of the common but advanced things you might want to do with a website can be added via plugins, and anything that doesn't exist as a plugin yet could be added via a custom made plugin if really needed.
   - Many other CMS (Content Management Systems) and "website builders" exist too. I'll work in them if a client or collaborator prefers, though that generally requires a bit of time for me to find where everything is in those tools, and they vary in how much you can customize a website built in them, and what features can be put in.
   - by painful experience, I only use HTML, CSS and JS for websites if I'm confident that the owner is skilled enough with those techs to be able to update the website themselves. Even for websites I'm looking after, wordpress is my current preference, except for the homepages of web-apps. WordPress just makes updating text and pictures so much more effecient and how people would expect, compared with updating HTML.
   
Over my career I've used a whole bunch of different programming languages, databases and frameworks - giving me quite a broad understanding of whats out there
   - Python is my second favourite programming language after JavaScript, though I've yet to use it for anything beyond little fun projects - I'd quite like that to change!
   - C# and Java feel great for highly engineered projects. I've not used them for years, mostly down to not needing that level of engineering.
   - mySQL and MS SQL Server are both great for storing data when JSON won't do. One of my personal projects "SQL GUI" is a tool to make designing databases easy to do on phones
