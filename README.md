Hi, I’m @PhilGanney

My main coding interests are websites and apps that help small businesses. 
My projects are more about innovating by applying existing techs, to new things, or with really nice designs, rather than creating brand new tech.
My main solo project is TeaRounder - tools for making food and drink ordering easier.
    read more about it, or use the free, personal use version, at tearounder.app
I'm also a founding admin of a community called ProtoStart. We collaborate on software projects, and help new coders find real projects that suit them.
We're using reddit.com/r/protostart to co-ordinate and find new collaborators initially, and are working on protostart.net


I often work in good old fashioned HTML, CSS & JavaScript
   - I tend to only use JavaScript libraries when it seems difficult to achieve something in regular JS (as opposed to building from the ground up with a favourite library)
   - Python is fun too, but I've yet to use it for anything beyond little fun projects - I'd quite like that to change!
   - In my early career and student days I used a whole bunch of different programming languages, databases and frameworks - giving me quite a broad understanding of whats out there
   
 
You can find me on ..
 - Reddit as PGDesign (I moderate r/ProtoStart - a space for collaborations, as well as r/TeaRounder - a sub for my TeaRounder project)
 - LinkedIn (as the founder of TeaRounder)
 - https://news.ycombinator.com/ and startupschool.org as PhillyG
